Exciting news! Dr. Chao-Yi Wu is a co-investigator on a newly awarded R21 grant from the National Institute on Aging. This project will explore the technical variability and feasibility of using dried blood spot samples to measure key Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, including pTau217, GFAP, and NfL. Congratulations to Dr. Wu and the research team!
