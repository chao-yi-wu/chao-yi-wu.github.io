Great news! Dr. Chao-Yi Wu has received a career award from the National Institute on Aging to develop a multi-modal information framework that combines different types of health data, including plasma and digital biomarkers, collected over decades. Using advanced machine learning, this work aims to better understand why Alzheimerâ€™s and related dementias affect people so differently, helping to create more personalized care for each individual.
