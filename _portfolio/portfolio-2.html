I have contributed to advancements in heterogeneity testing methods in the context of clinical trials and patient cohort monitoring. Any given Alzheimer’s disease (AD) treatments might be suitable for some but not all. This is due to the inherent heterogeneities of AD, which render a one-size-fits-all approach ineffective. However, treatment heterogeneity testing is rarely achieved in AD randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to characterize true responders. Studies below describe how intervention heterogeneity can be tested utilizing data from the I-CONECT RCT as a model. This study implemented an individual-level treatment response (ITR) approach to quantify treatment heterogeneity and its association with delayed disease progression. My work revealed significant treatment heterogeneity in cognitive endpoints; the top 30% of responders benefited from a delay in cognitive decline by 6 months compared to non-responders. This innovative analytical pipeline employs rigorous tree-based algorithms and advanced statistical models to construct responder profiles, offering valuable insights to guide trial enrichment strategies. In addition to evaluating non-pharmacological trials, I have also investigated the efficacy of a dietary supplement (Nicotinamide Riboside, TruNiagen®, NR) on cognitive and plasma biomarkers of AD. This study used a conventional two-arm parallel design followed by a crossover phase. Although this integrated design is more complex, it effectively doubles the sample size and increases statistical power to detect within-individual changes. Findings indicate a reduction in plasma pTau217 concentrations after taking NR, while an increase in pTau217 was observed with the placebo group. Together, these studies demonstrate my expertise and experience in the statistical design of AD clinical trials.
