I have contributed to the understanding of in-home behaviors relating to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by leveraging novel digital sensing technologies. Older adults spend approximately 83% of their day inside their residences; however, most research investigates out-of-home mobility and its health correlates. The paradigm of using digital biomarkers to measure functional outcomes is highly promising due to its potential to detect behavioral changes before the onset of MCI. To explore this potential, my studies have employed a ubiquitous sensing platform to capture spatiotemporal routines at real-world homes to measure the trips people make between indoor rooms over a month. My work reveals a significant linkage between high bathroom usage and kitchen activities with MCI, possibly due to biological (hormonal) and environmental (social) factors. My novel approach demonstrates that the nuanced differences in spatiotemporal routines would not be detected without the 24-hour data from continuous unobtrusive sensing. This study underscores a novel way of delineating cognitive health with chronologically-ordered movement across indoor locations, which can be crucial for setting endpoints in clinical trials and improving clinical practice for chronic diseases in late life. My work also discovered that an older adult's in-home moving pattern (e.g., the visit order of and time spent in rooms) is another indicator of cognitive changes. Older adults' room-to-room transition stability becomes viable when their cognition declines. Moreover, I conducted studies to ensure scientific findings of sensor-based research were reproducible and replicable. I successfully replicated and reproduced one of my previous works with the latest generation of sensing technology and new participants. This reproducibility study proved that reducing sample sizes in Alzheimer's clinical trials with in-home sensors is feasible.
