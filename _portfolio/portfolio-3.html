One line of my research is focusing on improving reproducibility and replicability in science, especially as data analytics play a growing role in large-scale studies. We published digital biomarker data showing that digital technologies can cut required sample sizes by half. To test the reliability of this finding, my lab conducted a follow-up replication study using newer technology. We arrived at similar conclusions, confirming the statistical robustness of the original results.
