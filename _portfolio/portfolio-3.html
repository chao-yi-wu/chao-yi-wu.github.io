One line of research in my lab focuses on improving reproducibility and replicability in science, especially as data analytics play a growing role in large-scale studies. In one study, we published digital biomarker data showing that digital technologies can cut required sample sizes by half. To test the reliability of this finding, my lab conducted a follow-up replication study using newer technology. We arrived at similar conclusions, confirming the statistical robustness of the original results.
