Dr. Wu presented two posters at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC). The first poster is about semi-passive monitoring of game play to detect learning curves distinctive to subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/mild-stage dementia. The second one is to understand how Much Time Can be Saved in Cognitive Decline when receiving the Internet-based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT).

She also finished a 5k run in 31 minutes!
