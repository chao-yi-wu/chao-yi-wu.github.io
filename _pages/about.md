As an occupational therapist and statistician with over a decade of experience in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) research, I am dedicated to advancing innovative approaches that transform how we measure, understand, and treat cognitive decline. My professional journey began in clinical practice, where I spent several years as a licensed occupational therapist in skilled nursing facilities. This hands-on experience with individuals living with dementia inspired my transition into research, where I now focus on applying modern technologies and advanced statistical methods to detect subtle cognitive changes in daily life.

**My work centers on two key areas: (1) digital biomarkers for cognitive and functional outcomes and (2) advanced trial methodologies to enable personalized dementia care.** I integrate expertise in biostatistics, aging rehabilitation, and home-based sensing technologies, including passive infrared motion sensors, electronic medication tracking, and driving behavior monitoring, to identify unique behavioral patterns associated with mild cognitive impairment. These patterns have demonstrated sensitivity to early cognitive changes, offering the potential to reduce sample size requirements in clinical trials. Since joining Massachusetts General Hospital, I have further expanded my focus on trial innovation through AI-generated digital twinning, developing pseudo-controlled trial models that estimate individual-level treatment effects. My research has been supported by NIA, two National Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), and I am a Research Education Component scholar in both Massachusetts and Oregon. I have a strong record of collaboration, serving as co-investigator, senior statistician, and data scientist on NIA grants proposals. These records reflect my strong and sustained commitment to ADRD research.
